# Week 2 Progress Report - Laugh Compass

> **Dates:** Monday, September 22 - Sunday, September 28, 2025  
> **Days spent:** 7 of 7 planned  
> **Hours Spent:** 12 of 14 planned

## 🛠️ Built

- Registered LaughCompass.com and created socials just in case.
- Set up Firebase infrastructure: dev/prod projects with Auth, Firestore, and Storage configured.
- Built responsive navbar using Headless UI.
- Implemented sticky footer with proper page layout spacing.
- Integrated Firebase authentication with Google sign-in.
- Configured Firebase Auth emulator for local development.

## ✅ Decided

- Decided I'll try to use the emulator as much as possible as recommended by Firebase. It's also pretty cool so far.

## 💭 Stuck/Learned

- Hit frustrating debugging sessions with Firebase CLI not explaining errors during `firebase init`, but Claude helped resolve quickly.
- Wasted time chasing an error that was only happening because I didn't realize I was navigating to a non-existent page.
- Learned about Next.js-specific environment variable naming quirks the hard way.
- Learned about Firebase emulators and how cool they are.
- Discovered that Tailwind CSS is amazing.

## 👉 Next

- Start coding against the Firebase services now that all infrastructure is ready.
