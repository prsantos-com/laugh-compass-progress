# Week 1 Progress Report - Laugh Compass

> **Dates:** Wednesday, September 17 - Sunday, September 21, 2025  
> **Active Days:** 5 of 5 planned  
> **Active Hours:** 9.5 of 10 planned

## 🛠️ Built

- Set up a basic Next.js project.
- Set up my Github repo with my code.

## ✅ Decided

- Decided to use [Headless UI](https://headlessui.com/) for my components. I've used [MUI](https://mui.com/) before, but I wanted to try and keep things as simple and lightweight as possible and try go get away from the look and feel of MUI. Since I'm using Tailwind and they built Headless UI, I went with it. I really want to find out if I truly need a more rich library like MUI or if this library works for me.
- Decided name of the site will be Laugh Compass. It was a name that I felt encompassed what I wanted the site to be, and also was easy to say.

## 💭 Stuck/Learned

- I wasted some time trying to one-shot a Next.js project with a starting home page using Claude and it was downright awful. It didn't work and when Claude fixed it, it was still garbage. I ended just following the Next.js tutorial and got a better result. In hindsight if I'm going to do that, I need to have some understanding of Next.js or whatever technology I'm using. Next.js is totally new to me, but very cool.

## 👉 Next

- Build out a basic layout for all the pages and set up my a Firebase project, configuration, and emulators to have a foundation for development.
