# Week 4 Progress Report - Laugh Compass

> **Dates:** Monday, October 6 - Sunday, October 13, 2025  
> **Active Days:** 5 of 7 planned  
> **Active Hours:** 10.5 of 14 planned

## 🛠️ Built

- Added the [Place Autocomplete widget](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/place-autocomplete-new) into the event adding page to get the lat and long of addresses.
- Added a central admin page that lists all the events in a table with a stats dashboard, because stats are hard to resist.
- Got the main listings page displaying correctly.
- Completed and published Week 3 progress report to Github.

## ✅ Decided

- I am going to ship in 1 to 2 weeks. I'm sensing that I'm trying to make things perfect or adding more scope, so the 2 week max cutoff is needed.

## 💭 Stuck/Learned

- The Place Autocomplete widget was a pain to implement. Not only is the Google documentation terrible, when I asked Claude for help it kept referring to deprecated code. That ate up a bit of my time and was frustrating.
- Claude gave me some bad code about redirects in Next.js, which I resolved once I slowed down and read the documentation. I really just need to spend more time on the fundamentals instead of just rushing through, though that's hard not to do when shortcuts are possible. Or just pay for Claude Code.

## 👉 Next

- Finish the admin functionality to edit and delete events.
- Add filter to find shows near me with precise location or city and radius.
- Add simple past shows page.
